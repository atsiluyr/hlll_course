And therefore, multiplying all these tiny probabilities to find product ( p of a test word “ j ” in class c ) will yield even a more smaller numerical value that often results in underflow which obviously means that for that given test sentence, the trained model will fail to predict it’s category/sentiment. So to avoid this underflow error, we take help of mathematical log as follows :\n",

        "* So now instead of multiplication of the tiny individual word probabilities, we will simply add them. And why only log? why not any other function? Because log increases or decreases monotonically which means that it will not affect the order of probabilities. Probabilities that were smaller will still stay smaller after the log has been applied on them and vice versa. so let’s say that a test word “is” has a smaller probability than the test word “happy”, so after passing these through log would although increase their magnitude but “is” would still have a smaller probability than “happy”. Therefore, without affecting the predictions of our trained model, we can effectively avoid the common pitfall of underflow error.\n",

It is only the key understanding which actually differentiates a true data scientist from a naive one and what actually matters when training a really good model. So before moving to API’s , I personally believe that a true data scientist should code from scratch to actually see behind the numbers and the reason why a particular algorithm is better than the other.\n",
